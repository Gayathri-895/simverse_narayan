## 🚀 Realistic Hackathon-Ready Prototype

This project was designed for impact, educational clarity, and visual excellence. It bridges the gap between biological theory and global environmental stewardship.

### ✨ Key Features

- **Dynamic Science Engine**: A rule-based mathematical model that calculates:
  - **Photosynthetic Efficiency**: Based on light intensity, CO₂ saturation, and temperature curves.
  - **O₂ Production & CO₂ Sequestration**: Real-time gas exchange rates.
  - **Plant Vitality & Growth**: Simulates life cycles from seedling to mature tree.
- **Premium Visualization**:
  - **Real-time Pipeline Chart**: Area graphs showing the O₂ vs CO₂ balance.
  - **Efficiency Gauge**: A live "speedometer" for the plant's metabolic rate.
  - **Evolutionary Icons**: Dynamic UI elements that reflect the plant's growth stage.
- **Global Impact Tracker**: A macro-level dashboard showing how local plant health affects planetary atmosphere stability.
- **Scenario Presets**: Instantly simulate environments like **Mars**, **Tropical Rainforests**, or **Arid Deserts**.
- **Student Challenges**: Integrated "Quests" to encourage discovery and scientific thinking.

## 🧪 The Science Behind GreenSim

GreenSim uses a multi-factor physics model:
- **Temperature**: Follows a Gaussian bell curve peaking at 25°C.
- **Light**: Uses a trigonometric saturation curve (Sine) to model photon absorption.
- **CO₂**: Implement logarithmic saturation to represent carbon limits in chloroplasts.
